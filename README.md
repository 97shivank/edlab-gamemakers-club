Mozilla HTML5 Game Club Resource - README

# Welcome

Welcome to the Mozilla HTML5 Game Club Resource. Many thanks for taking the time to look at our project. We hope this is a useful space and thank you in advance for any contribution you can make. 

##  Mozilla HTML5 Game Club Resource in a Nutshell

This resource is about creating a coding club to make Video Games to change the world. We help learners to be choose their own paths, work collaboratively and be inspired to make fun games with positive messages.

Fostering a new process and community to make and distribute  HTML5 “Video Games for Change”  where participants can contribute based on their own interests. 

This project aims to be a network of people to support issue-based, computer club activities, and a hub of resources to help such a process. Our particular focus will be on:

* Creating audio, visual and story assets for video games using free and open tools
* Coding web-based games in Javascript, phaser.io and the canvas based games
* Creating and acting out drama based scenarios to encourage a creative response to local and global issues especially “writing / coding in-role”

How to get involved to follow soon....
