# Welcome to the EdLab Game Making Club Resource 

Welcome to the EdLab Game Club Resource. Many thanks for taking the time to look at our project. We hope this is a useful space and thank you in advance for any contribution you can make. 

Currently this resource is to support the EdLab Game Making Club but we hope it will be of wider use so we are inviting other clubs and interested parties to contribute.

##  In a Nutshell

We want to make Web Games to Change the World. This project aims to be a network of people to support issue-based, computer club activities to make games. Together we will create a hub of resources to help this happen. Our particular focus will be on:

* [Creating audio, visual and story assets](https://github.com/mickfuzz/mozilla_html5_game_clubs/wiki#creating-game-assets) for video games using free and open tools
* [Coding web-based games in Javascript](https://github.com/mickfuzz/mozilla_html5_game_clubs/wiki#html5-game-making-full-tutorials) using phaser.io and the canvas based games and creating prototypes in Scratch
* [Fun activities inspiring a creative response to local and global issues (especially “writing / coding in-role”)](https://github.com/mickfuzz/mozilla-webgame-clubs/wiki/Teaching-and-Learning-Tips-for-Game-Making-Clubs)

We will help learners to be choose their own paths, work collaboratively and be inspired to make fun games with positive messages.

### Example Web Games in Glitch

We are actively seeking simple 'boilerplate' games in [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) to add to this list. See below for details on how to contribute. 

* [Simple Game Created to Be Edited](https://webgameclubs-simple-game-to-edit.glitch.me/)
* (Using old Thimble system) [Phaser Platform Game Tutorial from Richard and Alvin](https://thimbleprojects.org/piratepete/334344/)
* (Using old Thimble system)  [Intentionally Rubbish Phaser Platform for workshops](https://thimbleprojects.org/davegoopot/417060/)
