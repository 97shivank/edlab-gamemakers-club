# Welcome

Welcome to the Mozilla HTML5 Game Club Resource. Many thanks for taking the time to look at our project. We hope this is a useful space and thank you in advance for any contribution you can make. 

##  Mozilla HTML5 Game Club Resource in a Nutshell

Creating a coding club to make Video Games to change the world and allow learners to be choose their own paths,  work collaboratively and be inspired to make great campaign messages

Fostering a new process and community to make and distribute  HTML5 “Video Games for Change”  where participants can contribute based on their own interests. 

This project aims to be a network of people to support issue-based, computer club activities, and a hub of resources to help such a process. Our particular focus will be on:

* Creating audio, visual and story assets for video games using free and open tools
* Coding web-based games in Javascript, phaser.io and the canvas based games
* Creating and acting out drama based scenarios to encourage a creative response to local and global issues especially “writing / coding in-role”
