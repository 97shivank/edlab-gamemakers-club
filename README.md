# Welcome to the HTML5 Game Club Resource in a Nutshell

Welcome to the Mozilla HTML5 Game Club Resource. Many thanks for taking the time to look at our project. We hope this is a useful space and thank you in advance for any contribution you can make. 

Currently this resource is to support the Manchester Mozilla Game Making Club but we hope it will be of wider use so we are inviting other clubs and interested parties to contribute. 

##  Mozilla HTML5 Game Club Resource in a Nutshell

This resource is about creating a coding club to make Video Games to change the world. We help learners to be choose their own paths, work collaboratively and be inspired to make fun games with positive messages.

Fostering a new process and community to make and distribute  HTML5 “Video Games for Change”  where participants can contribute based on their own interests. 

This project aims to be a network of people to support issue-based, computer club activities, and a hub of resources to help such a process. Our particular focus will be on:

* Creating audio, visual and story assets for video games using free and open tools
* Coding web-based games in Javascript, phaser.io and the canvas based games and creating prototypes in Scratch
* Fun activities inspiring a creative response to local and global issues (especially “writing / coding in-role”)
