## What we're working on

### Making Remixable HTML5 Games using Thimble

We are using Phaser.io as our main frame for making HTML5 games and hosting examples at http://thimble.mozilla.org 

Help us to build up a resource of simple games which can remixed by club members or used as examples to inspire their own creations. 

Our current [list of starter games are here](https://github.com/mickfuzz/mozilla_html5_game_clubs/wiki#starter-games--thimble-tutorials)

### Sharing Game Assets and Tutorials on how to make them

We are curating a list of [links to tools and tutorials on making your own audio / video game assets here](https://github.com/mickfuzz/mozilla_html5_game_clubs/wiki#creating-game-assets).

### Documenting best practices on running Game Making Clubs

If you are an educator or researcher in this area, we would love you to share practice on how we can all best run Game Making Clubs. Some of the key challenges include, helping learners transition from visual coding to text coding, making our learning environment as accessible and appealing as possible and using physical assets to support concept learning.

## How to report bugs

Ask your contributors to stay on the lookout for can any potential issue that might cause problems for the project. These could be problems in code (if you’re creating software), content omissions or copy errors (if you’re creating a learning resource), or any issues with the functionality or design of your project. 

Most projects invite all contributors to report bugs, so "debugging" or fixing problems happens quickly and with the input of the community. Take a look at [Atom's example](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-bugs) for how to teach people to report bugs to your project.
