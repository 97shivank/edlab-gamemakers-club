# Contributing to WebGame Making Clubs

We welcome your contributions to the Mozilla HTML5 Game Making Club Resource. This resource suports individuals or coding clubs to make Video Games to change the world. We help learners to be choose their own paths, work collaboratively and be inspired to make fun games with positive messages.

This is a volunteer project and we can't do it without your help. This is a fantastically exciting area of emerging practice but unlike Scratch or commercial visual game making environments, there is still a need for user-friendly, beginner resources to get novice game makers, and club volunteers started and motivated. 


## Participation guidelines

This project adheres to a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [mick@flossmanuals.net](mailto:mick@flossmanuals.net).

## What we're working on right now

* [Creating Boilerplate HTML5 Games](#creating-boiler-plate--remixable-html5-games-using-thimble)
* [Front End Design of a Blogging / Resource Template](#an-inspirational-html-template-for-blogging-and-documentation)


### Creating Boiler plate / Remixable Web Games using Glitch

Can you write a simple game demo in Javascript? Help us create a resource of simple games which can remixed by club members or used as examples to inspire their own creations. 

We are using Phaser.io javascript game framework as our beginner framework for making HTML5 games and hosting examples at https://glitch.com/.  

Our current [list of starter games are here](https://github.com/mickfuzz/mozilla_html5_game_clubs/wiki#starter-games--thimble-tutorials)

To volunteer to write a game, [please Sign up here by creating an issue](https://github.com/mickfuzz/mozilla_html5_game_clubs/issues/new) or just write a game and contribute it to the games section of our codebase via a pull request. [See below for more details](#how-to-contribute-games-and-code-based-resources). 

NOTE: Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!

### Guidelines for Contributing games

Please follow the following guidelines for the format and approach of your games.

#### Game Project Structure

 1. **assets** include images and other assets used by the game in this folder
 2. **js** include your javascript files in here rather than linking out to online versions to make the project self contained
 3. **index.html** Please name a playable version of your game or a clear tutorial as index.html in your project

Other tips and tests:

**Will it work offline?** Try running your game project offline using Firefox, will it run or are there dependencies that make it unplayable offline?

#### Your Javascript

#### Javascript Game Code Guidelines

Please try to follow the following guidelines

* **Visibility of code**: Try to make the core code of your game as visible as possible. You may want to include your code in side the projects index.html file or in one game.js file 
* **Avoid using too many functions** Try to limit the complexity of your code by not nesting functions if you can avoid it to help novice coders
* **Please try to avoid jQuery** or other helper frameworks if they are not needed. jQuery is great but plain JS helps makes our code examples clearer to read and consistent. 
* **Use DR Principle** If you  Do Repeat some steps to avoid using more complicated coding structures that's ok. Prioritise clarity and readability over efficiency
 

## How to report bugs

Please be on the lookout for can any potential issue that might cause problems for the project. This may be content omissions or copy errors in our learning resources or any issues with the functionality or design of your project.

### Sharing Game Assets and Tutorials on how to make them

We are curating a list of [links to tools and tutorials on making your own audio / video game assets here](https://github.com/mickfuzz/mozilla_html5_game_clubs/wiki#creating-game-assets).

Please feel free to contribute to this wiki to add resources. 

### Documenting best educational practices on running Game Making Clubs

If you are an educator or researcher in this area, we would love you to share practice on how we can all best run Game Making Clubs. Some of the key challenges include, helping learners transition from visual coding to text coding, making our learning environment as accessible and appealing as possible and using physical assets to support concept learning. We are working on a [book to share practice here.](http://write.flossmanuals.net/learn-javascript-with-phaser/introduction/).  Pleae get in touch for details on how to contibute by emailing mick at flossmanuals.net.

### An Inspirational HTML template for blogging and documentation
We would love to use this repository and Hugo as our main blogging and documentation platform. We also want our web presense to be as inspirational as the contents of the club. So we are looking for a Web Dev/ Designer to create a Hugo site for us base page, a blogging template and a session documentation template. Could this be you?
See [this issue to find out more and volunteer ](https://github.com/webgameclubs/edlab-gamemakers-club/issues/30).
