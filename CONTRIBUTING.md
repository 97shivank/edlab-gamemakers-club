# Contributing to HTML5 Game Making Clubs

We welcome your contributions to the Mozilla HTML5 Game Making Club Resource. This resource suports individuals or coding clubs to make Video Games to change the world. We help learners to be choose their own paths, work collaboratively and be inspired to make fun games with positive messages.

This is a volunteer project and we can't do it without your help. This is a fantastically exciting area of emerging practice but unlike Scratch or commercial visual game making environments, there is still a need for user-friendly, beginner resources to get novice game makers, and club volunteers started and motivated.

### Creating Boiler plate / Remixable HTML5 Games using Thimble

Can you write a simple game demo in Javascript? Help us create a resource of simple games which can remixed by club members or used as examples to inspire their own creations. 

We are using Phaser.io javascript game framework as our main frame for making HTML5 games and hosting examples at http://thimble.mozilla.org 

Our current [list of starter games are here](https://github.com/mickfuzz/mozilla_html5_game_clubs/wiki#starter-games--thimble-tutorials)

To volunteer to write a game, [please Sign up here by creating an issue](https://github.com/mickfuzz/mozilla_html5_game_clubs/issues/new) or just write a game and contribute it to the games section of our codebase via a pull request. [See below for more details](#how-to-contribute-games-and-code-based-resources). 

### Sharing Game Assets and Tutorials on how to make them

We are curating a list of [links to tools and tutorials on making your own audio / video game assets here](https://github.com/mickfuzz/mozilla_html5_game_clubs/wiki#creating-game-assets).

### Documenting best educational practices on running Game Making Clubs

If you are an educator or researcher in this area, we would love you to share practice on how we can all best run Game Making Clubs. Some of the key challenges include, helping learners transition from visual coding to text coding, making our learning environment as accessible and appealing as possible and using physical assets to support concept learning. [Please contribute here](https://github.com/mickfuzz/mozilla_html5_game_clubs/wiki/Teaching-and-Learning-Tips-for-Game-Making-Clubs). 

### An Inspirational HTML template for blogging and documentation
We could use wordpress or tumblr or medium but....

We would love to use Thimble as our main blogging and documentation platform. In this way we can involve participants in our blogging process and they will also learn about altering HTML code.

However, we also want our web presense to be as inspirational as the contents of the club. So we are looking for a Web Designer to create a base page, a blogging template and a session documentation template. Could this be you?
See [this issue for details of the challenge](https://github.com/mickfuzz/mozilla_html5_game_clubs/issues/4). 

### Collaborating on Drama based games for the Game Making Club

Game Making clubs are about more than just making game assets and coding. We promote the creation of a community of play to unlock our creative potential. This project started in partnership with the Manchester Met Drama teaching department. We have an area of this resource dedicated to drama games and role plays to build club rapport and bring real life issues to life. [Please contribute here](https://github.com/mickfuzz/mozilla_html5_game_clubs/wiki/Teaching-and-Learning-Tips-for-Game-Making-Clubs).
