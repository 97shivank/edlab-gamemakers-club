## Making Remixable HTML5 Games using Thimble

We are using Phaser.io as our main frame for making HTML5 games and hosting examples at http://thimble.mozilla.org 

Help us to build up a resource of simple games which can remixed by club members or used as examples to inspire their own creations. 

There is an example of the Phaser game in Thimble https://thimbleprojects.org/mchesterman/301369/
