# Contributing to HTML5 Game Clubs

We welcome your contributions to the Mozilla HTML5 Game Making Club Resource. There are several ways that you can create resources and otherwise help the process. 

This resource is about creating a coding club to make Video Games to change the world. We help learners to be choose their own paths, work collaboratively and be inspired to make fun games with positive messages.

This is a volunteer project and we can't do it without your help. This is a fantastically exciting area of emerging practice but unlike Scratch or commercial visual game making environments, there is still a need for user-friendly, beginner resources to get novice game makers, and club volunteers started and motivated.

## What we're working on right now

### Making Remixable HTML5 Games using Thimble

We are using Phaser.io as our main frame for making HTML5 games and hosting examples at http://thimble.mozilla.org 

Help us to build up a resource of simple games which can remixed by club members or used as examples to inspire their own creations. 

Our current [list of starter games are here](https://github.com/mickfuzz/mozilla_html5_game_clubs/wiki#starter-games--thimble-tutorials)

### Sharing Game Assets and Tutorials on how to make them

We are curating a list of [links to tools and tutorials on making your own audio / video game assets here](https://github.com/mickfuzz/mozilla_html5_game_clubs/wiki#creating-game-assets).

### Documenting best practices on running Game Making Clubs

If you are an educator or researcher in this area, we would love you to share practice on how we can all best run Game Making Clubs. Some of the key challenges include, helping learners transition from visual coding to text coding, making our learning environment as accessible and appealing as possible and using physical assets to support concept learning.
