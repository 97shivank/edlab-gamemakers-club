# Contributing to WebGame Making Clubs

We welcome your contributions to this Game Making Club Resource. This resource aims to suport individuals or coding clubs to make web games with Phaser. This is a volunteer project and we can't do it without your help. This is a fantastically exciting area of emerging practice but there is still a need for user-friendly, beginner resources to get novice game makers, and club volunteers started and motivated. 

## Participation guidelines

This project adheres to a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [mick@flossmanuals.net](mailto:mick@flossmanuals.net).

## What we're working on right now

* [Creating Boilerplate Games with Phaser](#creating-boiler-plate--remixable-html5-games-using-thimble)
* [A Blogging / Resource Template](#an-inspirational-html-template-for-blogging-and-documentation)
* [Contribute to our resources on Asset Creating & Facilitation](#sharing-game-assets-and-tutorials-on-how-to-make-them)

## Creating Boiler plate / Remixable Web Games using Glitch

Can you write a simple game demo in Javascript using Phaser? Help us create a resource of simple games which can remixed by club members or used as examples to inspire their own creations. 

We are using Phaser.io javascript game framework as our beginner framework for making HTML5 games and hosting examples at https://glitch.com/.  

Our current [list of remixable starter games are here](https://github.com/webgameclubs/edlab-gamemakers-club/blob/master/README.md#remixable-web-games-in-glitch)

To volunteer to write a game, [please Sign up here by creating an issue](https://github.com/mickfuzz/mozilla_html5_game_clubs/issues/new) or just write a game in your own repository and let us know about it by creating an issue.

### Guidelines for Contributing games

Please follow the following guidelines and process when creating your your games.

#### Create a Game Repository

Create your own repository in GitHub or GitLab or Bitbucket. 
Make sure your game is available in the index.html file see below

#### Game Project Structure

 1. **assets** include images and other assets used by the game in this folder
 2. **js** include your javascript files in the repository in a folder called js or linking out to online versions of phaser
 3. **index.html** Please name a playable version of your game or a clear tutorial as index.html in your project

Other tips and tests:

**Will it work offline?** Try running your game project offline using Firefox, will it run or are there dependencies that make it unplayable offline?

#### Coding Guidelines

Please try to follow the following guidelines;

* **Declare Variables**: Put your variables at the start of the js project for clarity and to allow sharing between functions (while this creates global variables, we do this to make code easy to read)
* **Visibility of code**: Try to make the core code of your game as visible as possible. You may want to include your code in side the projects index.html file or in one js file 
* **Avoid using too many functions** Try to limit the complexity of your code by not nesting functions if you can avoid it to help novice coders
* **Please avoid jQuery** or other helper frameworks if they are not needed. jQuery is great but plain JS helps makes our code examples clearer to read and consistent. 
* **Use DR Principle** If you  Do Repeat some steps to avoid using more complicated coding structures that's ok. Prioritise clarity and readability over efficiency
* **Follow the JavaScript code standards** Try to follow the [coding standards from W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_conventions.asp)

## An Inspirational HTML template for blogging and documentation
We would love to use this repository and Hugo as our main blogging and documentation platform. We also want our web presense to be as inspirational as the contents of the club. So we are looking for a Web Dev/ Designer to create a Hugo site for us base page, a blogging template and a session documentation template. Could this be you?
See [this issue to find out more and volunteer ](https://github.com/webgameclubs/edlab-gamemakers-club/issues/30).
